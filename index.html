At the time of this writing, the most recent mural piece on Northeastern’s Campus is Plumage by Filipe Ortiz. This is in a style described by Ortiz himself as “explosive nature”. Upon reviewing past murals and art in the Explosive Nature by Ortiz, this piece depicts much more realistic, organic depth  and movement. It is a refinement of the explosive nature style that Ortiz has been developing.

<p style="color:black;font-size:18px;">“Plumage” depicts many different birds in flight on the walls of Stearns hall that face Huntington avenue. According to News@Northestern, Ortiz chose many migratory birds to reflect his own immigrations and journey that is similar to those bird’s flight patterns. It reflects the growth diversity and travel of the Northeastern student body. </p>
